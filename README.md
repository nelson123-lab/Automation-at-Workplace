# Automation-at-Workplace

The situation is happening in the workplace where I have to store some information from the learner and store it in an excel file where all the information of the other learners are also present. Since learner data is confidential, I am not allowed to enter data directly to the spreadsheet as it would cause in data privacy issues.

Currently the project in on hold as there is an issues of all the computers gets data wipped at 2:00am everyday. Thus the automation with the python on the computer won't be suitable. Currrently working on making a User Interface and making the program as an installable file so that it can be kept in the reserved area which does not get wipped everyday. 

There is a web version of the same which is currently on implementation as well.
